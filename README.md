Research goal: my goal is to examine NYC taxi data, along with external weather and event data, in order to predict how much revenue might be expected for a particular NYC location, and for a particular time of the day. The intended audience for this analysis is the taxi companies, so that they can dispatch taxis to where they are most likely to maximise revenues. 

Timeline: the data is analysed from May 2020 to May 2023
